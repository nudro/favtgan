This repo includes:

<p>

GAN implementation in PyTorch to include the code for:
- Under `favtGAN/favtGAN`, the favtGAN baseline, no noise, noisy labels, and Gaussian designs, in addition to the data loaders, and sample bash scripts to call parameters. As an example to run training open terminal and enter the prompt `bash train_EI_sensor_baseline.sh`
- Under `favtGAN/pix2pix`, the implementation by Erik Lindernoren at https://github.com/eriklindernoren/PyTorch-GAN#pix2pix, with the only modification of one-sided smooth labels for the valid tensor.
